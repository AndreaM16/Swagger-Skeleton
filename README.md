# Swagger-Skeleton
Swagger JS Skeleton to deploy easily on a Server

## How to use
 - Create a `.json` containing your swagger documents.
 - Move it inside `api-docs` folder
 - Change line `37` in `index.html` to point to your file. E.g. : `url = "/api-docs/api-docs.json";`
 - Move your folder wherever you want to load it up with a web server. If you are lazy like me, use Google Server.

## And now?
Edit your `.json` and have fun or think about committing sudoku (ensure to have a sharp sword).
